<tr><td>04-dec-2014</td><td>It appears 32 students at Reading University simultaneously computed the same area average in the CRU TS 3.22 0.5&deg; dataset. That was enough to bring the system to its knees. Please, either use a lower resolution dataset, pre-compute it beforehand so that it will have been cached or let no more than 8 students operate on these large datasets simultaneously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>04-dec-2014</td><td>The Climate Explorer has been down from noon UTC (13:00 local time) to 14:00 TC (15:00 local time). I could not enter it either and will now try to figure out what happened.</td></tr>
<tr><td>28-nov-2014</td><td>Fixed a subtle bug in the caching scheme that I introduced a few months ago. The system would claim that an uploaded file was invalid because of an invalid cached netcdf file (thanks Clementine).</td></tr>
<tr><td>26-nov-2014</td><td>Ran out of disk space again, the new dataserver has been delayed. Please report corrupted datasets :-(</td></tr>
<tr><td>18-nov-2014</td><td>Finally added a few new colour scales that also work for colour blind people (requested by David 15 years ago). Please test now, they will become the default after the test period.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17-sep-2014</td><td>Added ERA-interim daily evapotranspiration, I have no idea how good it is though (thanks Michael).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11-sep-2014</td><td>First attempt to plot the trends of extremes for sets of stations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10-sep-2014</td><td>Added the possibility to compute the mean/min/max of sets of stations.</td></tr>

<tr><td>04-sep-2014</td><td>The GEV(T) routine (trends in extremes) now also works for sets of stations, which are assumed to be independent and identically distributed. This is OK for most summer rainfall observations, but not much else.</td></tr>
<tr><td>01-sep-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug that prevented subtracting the regression of multiple indices from a time series. Not sure this has ever worked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26-aug-2014</td><td>Server has been down for ten minutes to increase the memory from 12 GB to 48 GB, this should make it easier to analyse large datasets and avoid the slowdowns sometimes associated with a largish number of students doing the same exercise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20-aug-2014</td><td>Redefined the ratio on the trend of extremes page to mean the return time of old over the return time of new.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17-jul-2014</td><td>Update CRU TS to 3.22 1901-2013 (thanks Harry).</td></tr>

<tr><td>24-apr-2014</td><td>The plots of trends in extremes now shift the distribution rather than the observation (Thanks Fredi, Nathalie, Myles).</td></tr>
<tr><td>24-apr-2014</td><td>There was a possibility that your metadata for an uploaded file survived the nightly cleaning script whereas the data itself would not. When someone else re-used the number the metadata pointed to that other file. I added some checking and hope that is enough to kill this problem (thanks William).</td></tr>
<tr><td>24-apr-2014</td><td>The CMIP5 sic (sea-ice concentration) fields were incomplete, re-running the scripts (Thanks Kenneth).</td></tr>
<tr><td>14-apr-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug in the ERA-interim Tmin/Tmax fields. These accidentally only considered the minimum/maximum temperature over 6-12 UTC and 18-24 UTC, not the other half of the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14-apr-2014</td><td>Fixed a big bug in the Berkeley TMIN/TMAX monthly gridded fields, which had the time axis off by four months since 8 March 2014 (thanks Rob).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11-apr-2014</td><td>Updated CRU scPDSI to the version based on 3.21 (thanks Gerard).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11-apr-2014</td><td>Added SPEI 3 and 6 months fields due to popular demand, they are now based on CRU 3.20 and run to 2011.</td></tr>

<tr><td>02-apr-2014</td><td>CRU TS upgraded to 3.21 (thanks Harry).</td></tr>
<tr><td>26-mar-2014</td><td>I think the GEV fit to extremes with trend now also works properly with the "scale" option (adjusting &mu; and &sigma; simultaneously). The numbers were correct but the plot was off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26-mar-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug in reading daily netcdf files if the start year was later than the first year of data (leap year problem). The answer was almost always nonsense, no correlation at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>20-mar-2014</td><td>The error in the 0.25&deg; E-OBS fields has been fixed (an old version of nco corrupted the file with more than 2^31 values).</td></tr>

<tr><td>05-feb-2013</td><td>The monthly update failed on a full hard disk, which means quite a few files have been corrupted. I am repairing most, please let me know which ones I missed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>09-jan-2013</td><td>Changed the way countries are treated: if a region (island) is too small to have a grid point in the interior it contributes proportional to its area. This way small countries still give a result, even though it may not be completely representative of the area of the country itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>09-jan-2013</td><td>Added a set of 235 countries to the pre-defined masks. Also split up a few countries with overseas parts. Please send me useful subdivisions if you need these.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16-dec-2013</td><td>The 2013 ERA-interim 3D fields have the order of the levels reversed, so that the 850mb level was continued with 300mb etc. Fixed. (Thanks Phil.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>11-dec-2013</td><td>A typo introduced a month ago (lack of concentration...) meant that netcdf files with a "since" date with days other than one were offset in time. This affected the ERA-interim files (offset 14 months), possibly others (thanks Phil).</td></tr>

<tr><td>08-jul-2013</td><td>A large part of the June 2013 data are available now</td></tr>
<tr><td>25-jun-2013</td><td>Added the possibility to average fields over irregular region, either pre-defined SREX regions or uploaded by the user.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25-jun-2013</td><td>Whoever is teaching a course at 212.205.78.34 in Greece please do NOT use big datasets like CRU TS 3.1, GPCC 0.5&deg;, the server can only handle 2 or 3 of these at the same time, not six.</td><tr>
<tr><td>24-jun-2013</td><td>The zombie bug in the CESM1-CAM5 r3i1p1 data that was squashed more than a year ago has risen from the grave again. I deleted all data from this run until the correct version again replaces the buggy one and is propagated (thanks Kenneth)</td><tr>
<tr><td>20-jun-2013</td><td>Fixed a serious bug in the field filtering routine that wrote Feb 29 in non-leap years as zeroes into the output file (as Mar 1 the first time, Mar 2 the  second, etc). This also meant the output was too long. I hope no-one else was bitten by this one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19-jun-2013</td><td>Updated the field significance routine to include statements for return times and to use a somewhat different way to estimate the decorrelation length which emphasises the signal regions more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19-jun-2013</td><td>Fixed a bug in the running correlation routine: the scatterplot at the end contained the last random sereis from teh Monte Carlo significance test rather than real data. Fixed. (thanks Tim).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11-jun-2013</td><td>Updated the CMIP5 tos (SST) fields. CSIRO now has -1.8&deg;C under sea ice, I was shown a way to interpolate the CMCC and GFDL fields as well (thanks Enrico), only BNU-ESM is still missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10-jun-2013</td><td>GPCP daily precipitation updated to v1.2, which also brings it up-to-date (thanks Rogier).</td></tr>

<tr><td>16-apr-2013</td><td>The cause of yesterday's crash seems to be a course at ICTP that overwhelmed the server.

(ten small, low-resolution ones, only two CRU TS 0.5&deg; fields at the same time). It is essential to tell the students not to re-try when the machine is slow, as that will bring it down completely.
