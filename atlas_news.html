<td>20-aug-2014</td><td>Added states of the US.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>20-aug-2014</td><td>Removed INMCM4 and IPSL-CM5B-LR from the fd (frost days) ensemble because they have far too many frost days in tropical regions and Europe (thanks Claudia).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>15-aug-2014</td><td>Changed the presentation of differences in extreme variables that count the number of days (frost days, ice days, ...), so that areas with less than one day per year in the current climate stay white (thanks Claudia).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>10-jul-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug in the trends (regressions) where only one percentile plot was shown as the name was not unique across percentiles.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>23-may-2014</td><td>Upgraded CRU TS to version 3.21 (thanks Michael).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>22-may-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug introduced two days ago that prevented time series of seasons being computed (thanks Michael).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>20-may-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug that prevented non-linear trends of annual (extreme) data to be computed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>20-may-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug that prevented time series of relative anomalies annual time series to be computed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>19-may-2014</td><td>Switched to the CCCMA altcdd and altcwd to avoid problems in 2005 and 2006 in almost always dry/wet regions (thanks Slava).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>19-may-2014</td><td>Maps with the combined scenarios RCP4.5/RCP6.0/RCP8.5 now also work for extremes, where it is most useful (thanks Andreas).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>14-may-2014</td><td>Fixed a bug that for time series the scenarios would always be selected if they had once been selected (thanks Albert).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>09-jan-2014</td><td>Changed the way countries are treated: if a region (island) is too small to have a grid point in the interior it contributes proportional to its area. This way small countries still give a result, even though it may not be completely representative of the area of the country itself.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>03-jan-2014</td><td>Added all countries and autonomous regions of the world to the list of predefined regions. Please let me know if you prefer to have sub-categaries like I made for the Netherlands, France.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>22-dec-2013</td><td>Added soil moisture, please note that the reliability is not very high.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>06-dec-2013</td><td>Implemented remembering forms for nonimous users. This shoudl also improve the user experience on tablets and smartphones.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>28-nov-2013</td><td>Added <a href="http://www.cccma.ec.gc.ca/data/climdex/climdex.shtml" target=_new>CCCMA ETCCDI</a> CMIP5 annual extremes, it looks as if I have fixed the bugs, please let me know if you find suspicious results.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>21-nov-2013</td><td>Added CMIP5 relative humidity.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>16-nov-2013</td><td>Added observational datasets.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>13-nov-2013</td><td>Added ERA-interim, 20CR.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>13-nov-2013</td><td>Added CMIP3.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>13-nov-2013</td><td>Regression-based trends also work now.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>06-nov-2013</td><td>Time series of relative changes over non-standard meteorological seasons still had a problem up to now, fixed (thanks Maarten).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>06-nov-2013</td><td>Time series now work well for relative and absolute values as far as I can see. Please disregard results obtained before now.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>06-nov-2013</td><td>Maps did not work for half a day due to a typo.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>01-nov-2013</td><td>I think I got the time series section to work as well. Please report bugs.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>26-oct-2013</td><td>Added evaporation, net water flux (P-E), Tmin, Tmax, specific humidity, surface solar radiation (downward) and sea-level pressure.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>25-oct-2013</td><td>Maps of differences of temperature and precipitation of other lengths now also include hatching.</td>
</th><tr>
<td>17-oct-2013</td><td>Maps of 20-yr differences of temperature and precipitation work and for the seasons in the IPCC WG1 Ar5 Annex I "Atlas" give the same results.</td>
