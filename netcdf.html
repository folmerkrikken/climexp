<h2>NetCDF file requirements</h2>

The Climate Explorer will accept any netCDF file provided it meets the
following requirements.

<ol>

<li>There is exactly one variable called 'lon*' or 'x' with units
'degree[s]_e*'.

<li>There is exactly one variable called 'lat*' or 'y' with units
'degree[s]_n*'.

<li>There is exactly one variable called 'time*' or 't' with units
'months since yyyy-mm*' containing consecutive months.

<li>There is exactly one variable not called 'time*' or 't' that
depends at least on time and preferably on x and y, possibly on a
single-level variable 'z'.  Missing values are indicated by numbers
larger than a bit less than min(_FillValue,missing_value,valid_max) if
this is positive, exactly that number if it is negative.

</ol>

'*' denotes anything, [x] denotes x is optional.  All name
requirements are case insensitive.

<p>I have very little experience working with netCDF (COARDS
conventions), this covered the two files that I have experimented
with.  Please let <a href="mailto:oldenborgh@knmi.nl">me</a> know if
the conditions should be relaxed.
